# 3 containers of water

There are three containers with the capacity 2N+1 (small), 2N+3 (medium) and 4N+4 (large), where N is any natural number. Initially the large container is full of water and other two are empty. It is possible to measure any quantity from 1 to 4N+4 using above containers by transferring amount from one container to another without dropping any amount of water outside. Write an algorithm that takes N and the target to be measured as the input and display all the steps along with the minimum number of steps required.
